# Pedagogical Learning styles

## Introduction

In today's rapidly changing world, the traditional educational model is no longer sufficient to prepare students for the future of work. The future requires individuals who are not only knowledgeable but also creative, problem solvers, tech-savvy, and have a growth mindset. The Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method is designed to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the future of work. This comprehensive and holistic approach to education combines elements of the Flipped Classroom, High-Tech Approach, High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning, Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing, Personalized Learning, High Tech and Low Tech Game-Based Learning, and Universal Design for Learning.

## Flipped Classroom and High-Tech Approach
The Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method starts with the flipped classroom approach, where students watch video lectures and complete readings and quizzes outside of class, while class time is spent on active learning activities such as discussions, group work, and problem-solving. This allows students to learn at their own pace, providing teachers with more time to work with students one-on-one or in small groups. Additionally, high-tech approach emphasizes the use of technology in the classroom to enhance learning. This can include the use of digital resources such as videos, simulations, and interactive whiteboards, as well as the integration of mobile devices and other technology tools.

## High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning and Personalized Learning
The Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method also includes High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning. This approach focuses on students' active engagement in the learning process, where students are encouraged to ask questions and explore the subject matter on their own. By using technology, students can access a wealth of information and resources, which allows them to take ownership of their learning. This is paired with personalized learning, where instruction is tailored to the unique needs and interests of each student. This can include the use of technology tools to provide individualized instruction, as well as the use of formative assessments to track student progress and adjust instruction accordingly.

## Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing
Real-world, hands-on learning experiences are a crucial component of the Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method. This includes internships, trips, and job shadowing opportunities that allow students to apply what they have learned in the classroom to real-world situations. These experiences provide students with a chance to connect with industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators, gaining insight into the future of work and the skills required to succeed in it.

## High Tech and Low Tech Game-Based Learning and Universal Design for Learning
To further engage students and make learning more interactive, the Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method incorporates game-based learning. This approach uses games and simulations to teach and reinforce key concepts and skills. The Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method also includes Universal Design for Learning (UDL) which is an approach that provides all students with equal opportunities to learn by proactively addressing potential barriers and creating flexible learning environments.

## Conclusion
The Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method is a comprehensive and holistic approach to education that combines elements of the Flipped Classroom, High-Tech Approach, High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning, Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing, Personalized Learning, High Tech and Low Tech Game-Based Learning, and Universal Design for Learning.
